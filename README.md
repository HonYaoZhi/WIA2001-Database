## Best SQL Statements for Beverage Shop Management:

### 1. Top Selling Drinks by Quantity:
Retrieve a list of drinks sold in a specified month and year, ordered from highest to lowest quantity sold. This helps in identifying the most popular beverages during a specific period.

### 2. Ingredient Stock Details:
Get the stock amount for each ingredient along with their details. This query simplifies inventory management by providing information on ingredient quantities and their respective suppliers.

### 3. Customer Order Frequency:
Retrieve the total number of orders placed by each customer, including customer ID, name, contact, and email. This data is valuable for implementing loyalty programs based on customer order frequency.

### 4. Beverage Revenue Analysis:
Retrieve the total revenue generated by each beverage in a specified year and month. This query helps in identifying which beverages contribute the most to the shop's revenue.
